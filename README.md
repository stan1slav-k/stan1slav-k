#### 1. Telegram memes channels reposts analysis

<img src="https://github.com/stan1slav-k/stan1slav-k/blob/main/graphs.gif?raw=true" height="400"/></h1>

In this project, I create graph of reposts between memes channel in Telegram. To achieve this goal i made this steps:
- Get access to Telegram via teleton library
- Start from first input channel, I parse messages and get lists of unique reposted channels
- Add new channels in list and continue parsing them (traversing tree in width with setted depth)
- In the end we receive table with channels repost (from - to)
 -With this data I create relation graph with Network module form pyvis library, which use JS under the hood and provide in result interactive graph in HTLM
- Additionally I received list of top reposted channels and most reposting channels

Results: I created repost relation graph. Got acquainted with teleton, pyvis and asyncio libraries. Realized that at some amount of data common graph representation lose sense. And discover some new memes channel.
